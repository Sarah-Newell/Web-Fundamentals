            <h5>Daycare Rules and Regulations</h5>
                <ul>    
                <li>Daycare ends at 5pm but we realize many parents are just getting out of work at 5pm so we give you a grace period until 5:45pm to pick up your kids. Please know that promptly after 5:45 we start charging $5.00/hour/dog for pick-up until our closing hour and $20/hour/dog after closing hour. We are very strict with our schedules.</li>
                <li>There are no graces periods for weekend daycare pick-ups. Therefore after 4pm there is a $20/hour/dog fee.</li>
                <li>If you have any questions about our hours of operation, and pricing procedures please see our FAQ's.</li>
                </ul>
                <h7>Early Drop-Offs:</h7>  
                <ul>
                <li>K9 Kampus understands that there will be times that our clients may need to drop off before outdoors are officially open.</li>

                <li>It is important to understand that all our attention is given to our current boarders prior to opening. When a dog enters the facility for daycare or boarding drop-off it requires additional staff to be on-site, therefore, we require pre-arrangements and fees for early drop-offs to be pre-paid.</li>
                <li>Please note that if you arrive before our hours of operation, you may not be allowed entry until we are officially open.</li>

            <h7>General Information:</h7>

                <p><u>Boarding Drop-Off Times:</u> 8:30am-11am Monday-Friday and  9:30am-11am Saturday & Sunday.</p> 
                <p>Arriving after 11am up to 1pm is an additional fee of $5/hr/dog. After 1pm there is a $25 fee/dog and you may be turned away for arriving after the required time. It is recommended and preferred to have all boarders dropped off no later than 11am so that they can get a lot of attention and play time so they are nice and tired for bed. This is especially important for those dogs that experience night-time anxiety while away from home.</p>

                <p><u>Pick-Up Times:</u> 8:30am-3pm Monday-Friday  and  9:30am-3pm Saturday & Sunday. We appreciate it when boarding dogs are picked up prior to our busy times of the day.</p>

                <p>Our boarding fees are calculated based on a 24 hour period. For example if you dropped off your dog at 9am Monday and picked up your dog at 9am Tuesday your fee would be the one night boarding fee with no additional charges (unless you added excursions onto your dogs stay). If you drop off at 9am Monday but do not pick up until 5pm on Tuesday you will be charged the one night boarding fee and one day of daycare. Unlike other facilities we do not automatically charge you another night of boarding if you don't pick up by a certain time, we only charge you for how long you are in the facility after your drop in time.</p>
