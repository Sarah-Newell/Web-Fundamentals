            <h5>Important Details:</h5>
            <p>Vaccines are the RESPONSIBILITY of the parents. Please note we cannot allow any dog into our facility with expired vaccines. Our system will email various reminders including vaccines as long as you have a valid email on file. Required Vaccines: Rabies, Distemper/Parvo, Bordetella, Canine Influenza. At this time K9 Kampus does not require Lepto but we highly recommend it. We reserve the right to require this vaccine on a case by case basis dependent on the home location of the dog.</p>

            <p>Daycare hours: 7am-5pm Monday-Friday & 9am-4pm Saturday and Sunday.  We provide a 45 minute grace period Monday thru Friday because we understand most people work till  5pm, therefore, additional fees will not apply until after 5:45pm.</p>
            <p>Daycare Reservations are required for daycare. Clients are to reserve their reservations via their online client portal for daycare no -later than 5pm the evening before (Tuesday thru Saturday) and 4pm the evening before (Saturday and Sunday)</p>
            <p>Daycare fee is $35/day, we provide a $5 discount ($30/day) if you are reserved by end of daycare the day before you want to attend. Reserving in advance will also qualify you for any specials we have for that day (i.e. Free Pool Party). If you are NOT reserved discounts for daycare cannot be applied, which includes pre-paid daycare packages.</p> 
            <p>We will still accept call-ins/walk-ins however, daycare is at a higher rate and does not qualify for any current specials being offered. If we reach capacity we may have to turn away non-reserved clients. You can reserve in person with the front desk, call in to the front desk, or reserve using our online system via your client login. We do not recommend email as we are not always able to check email regularly. Walk-ins & Call-ins must be in the facility no later than 10:00am.</p>
            <p><b>Boarding:</b></p> <p>Boarding reservations are not confirmed until a 50% Non-Refundable deposit is received. No Deposit=No Reservation. Cancellations for boarding reservations received within a minimum of 72 hours notice will result in the boarding deposit being placed on your K9 Kampus account to be used towards future services. Cancellation for boarding received with less than a 72 hour notice will result in the boarding deposit being forfeited.</p>
            <p>Additional Detail information is listed when you click to reserve Daycare, Boarding, Grooming and Training.</p>
            <p>Boarding Fees: Our boarding fees are calculated based on a 24 hour period. For example if you dropped off your dog at 9am Monday and picked up your dog at 9am Tuesday your fee would be the one night boarding fee with no additional charges (unless you added excursions onto your dogs stay). If you drop off at 9am Monday but do not pick up until 5pm on Tuesday you will be charged the one night boarding fee and one day of daycare. Unlike other facilities we do not automatically charge you another night of  boarding if you donâ€™t pick up by a certain time, we only charge you for how long you are in the facility after your drop in time.</p>
            <p><b>HOLIDAY Boarding:</b></p>
            <p>Certain holidays require a holiday fee per day. Other facilities will increase their fees for specific seasons, this increase all services for all clients during their specified season. K9 Kampus does not have increased fees for all services during specified seasons. We only charge holiday fees for the clients that are using our services during the actual holidays. Our fees are usually $10/dog/day for the designated season and $5/cat or small animal/day/ (Holidays fees are subject to change and my vary from holiday to holiday. Please be sure to confirm the fees for any holiday you are planning boarding for. Holiday fees are do at the time of making your reservation and are Non-Refundable, no exceptions.</p>
            <p>On most holidays K9 Kampus does NOT offer any drop-offs or pick-ups. If exceptions are made by the owner an additional drop off fee will apply at a minimum of $50/dog/cat/small animal.</p>
            <p><h5>Leads:</h5></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Retractable Leads are NOT allowed anywhere on the premises. Due to injuries to other dogs, staff and clients we no longer allow the use of retractable leads anywhere on the premises.</li>
                <li>Your dogs must be on a lead and in your complete control from the time you get out of your car until you hand them off to a pet pal. Do not let your dog walk around without a lead</li>
                <li>Slip leads are recommended when dropping your dog off for Daycare and Boarding. This provides a secure lead and easy off/on for our Pet Pals.</li>
                <li>If you choose not to use our recommended slip leads you will be required to take your leash/collar/harness with you after drop off and bring it back at pick up.</li>
                <li>If you choose to use our recommended slip leads we will keep your slip lead in a cubby with your dogs name on it so it is ready for you when you pick up your dog.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><h5>Collars:</h5></p> 
            <p>Since COVID we currently only accept Slip Leads into the facility but the following guidelines are still provided for your information.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>NO FLEA COLLARS ALLOWED: Please remove flea collars before entering the facility. All types of collars must be removed before your dog enters the play area anyway. Flea collars contain chemicals and Pet Pals are NOT permitted to touch these collars as it leaves chemicals on their hands we do not want these chemicals transfered to the dogs.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you enter the facility with a Flea collar on you will be requested to remove the collar and take it with you.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>NO PRONG COLLARS ALLOWED:Although we understand some clients may feel the need to use prong collars, we are no longer allowing them in the facility. So you may use them to walk your dog into the facility, but you must remove the prong collar after we place a slip lead on your dog and take the prong collar with you. At pick up we will place a slip lead on your dog and will accommodate you while you replace the prong collar on your dog. Please note that K9 Kampus recommends slip leads in place of prong collars and found when used correctly will work even better than prong collars. If you are interested in learning more about slip leads please let us know and we will be happy to help you.
                <li>If you are not going to use a slip lead for Daycare & Boarding purposes we request that you use a collar that is easy-on, easy-off to make the process easier and faster for our Pet Pals.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Please DO NOT use buckle collars</li>
                        <li>Please do not use a harness unless it is absolutely necessary</li>
                    </ul>        
                <li>We request easy slip leads that act as a collar and lead in one</li>
                    <ul>    
                        <li>If you do not use a slip lead we request an easy slip on collar</li>
                        <li>Please do not come to daycare/boarding with more than 1 collar on</li>
                    </ul>

                <li><b>Multiple Dogs:</b> If you are bringing more than one dog to daycare/boarding please bring one dog into the facility at a time. Due to injuries cause to other clients in the lobby because of how excited the dogs are to enter or leave we are requiring 1 parent/client per dog.
